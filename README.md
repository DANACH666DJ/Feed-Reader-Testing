Feed Reader Testing requirements.

## Instructions

This project is based on the Jasmine testing tool to test the different functionality that can be critical in the normal operation of this app.

The main goal of this project and for which it is created is to familiarize ourselves with the Jasmine framework, which offers us many different functionalities which we can use to generate a clean and error-free code that can cause a serious problem in the long run for any project in development.


* In this project we test the following test groups.
  They are the following:

    * RSS Feeds (it tests to make sure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is notempty),
    * The Menu (it tests that ensures the menu element is hidden by default),
    * Initial Entries(it tests that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, and there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container),
    * New Feed Selection(its tests that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes)

In future improvements it is planned to add different tests to improve the web app.

## Instructions of execution

1. As a first step to run the app you should download or clone this repo in your local work environment.
2. Then you should run the index.html file that is in the base of the project and then you should see the app    running.
2. Once you have the app started, at the bottom of the app you will see the part of Jasmine where you can check the status of your tests.
